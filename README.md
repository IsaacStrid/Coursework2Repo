🚀 Project Plan: Strava-Premium Like Fitness App

Objective:
Develop a fitness tracking app with premium features like advanced analytics, route planning, leaderboards, and social engagement.

📌 Phase 1: Planning & Architecture

Define core features: GPS tracking, activity logs, social features, performance insights
Choose tech stack:
Frontend: React Native (for cross-platform mobile), Next.js (for web)
Backend: Node.js (Express or NestJS) or Django/FastAPI
Database: PostgreSQL (for structured data) + Redis (for caching)
Cloud: AWS/GCP/Azure for hosting and storage
Authentication: Firebase/Auth0 for user management
📂 Phase 2: Database Development

Tasks:
✅ Schema Design:

Users Table (ID, Name, Email, Password, Subscription Status, Profile Image)
Activities Table (User ID, Type, Distance, Time, Calories, Route, Date)
Routes Table (User ID, GPS Coordinates, Elevation, Distance, Map Image)
Leaderboards Table (Activity Type, User Rank, Best Times, Points)
Social Table (Friends, Comments, Likes)
Subscription Table (User ID, Plan Type, Expiry Date, Payment Info)
✅ Database Setup & Optimization:

Set up PostgreSQL (for relational data)
Use PostGIS for geo-location & route storage
Indexing & Query Optimization for fast analytics
✅ Data Sync & Storage:

Integrate Redis for caching frequently accessed data
Set up AWS S3 for storing media like profile images & route screenshots
✅ Security & Compliance:

Encrypt sensitive data (bcrypt for passwords)
Implement GDPR & HIPAA-compliant data storage policies
🛠️ Phase 3: Backend Development

Tasks:
✅ Authentication & User Management:

OAuth with Google, Apple, Facebook
JWT-based API authentication
Firebase/Auth0 integration
✅ Activity Tracking & Logging API:

API to log runs, cycling activities, swims (POST /activity/log)
GPS tracking data handling (POST /activity/route)
Real-time data syncing with mobile devices
✅ Leaderboard & Social APIs:

GET /leaderboard?type=running (fetch best performances)
POST /social/like (like an activity)
WebSockets for real-time updates
✅ Premium Features (For Paid Users):

AI-based activity analysis (e.g., pace optimization, fatigue tracking)
Predictive analytics (e.g., "Best time to run based on weather")
Advanced route planning with heatmaps
✅ Payment & Subscription Management:

Integrate Stripe/PayPal for payments
API for plan upgrades/downgrades (POST /subscription/change)
Auto-renewal logic for subscriptions
✅ Performance & Scaling:

Rate limiting to prevent abuse (Redis + Nginx)
Microservices architecture for scaling individual features
Implement GraphQL for flexible data querying
🎨 Phase 4: Frontend Development

Tasks:
✅ Mobile App (React Native):

User Dashboard: View stats, weekly progress, personal records
Live Activity Tracking: GPS-enabled real-time tracking
Social Feed: See friends' activities, comment & like
Challenges & Leaderboards: Compete in global/local challenges
✅ Web App (Next.js):

User Profile & History: View past runs, insights, analytics
Leaderboard Page: Ranks & achievements
Subscription Management: Upgrade plan, billing dashboard
✅ UI/UX Design & Optimization:

Dark Mode & Theme Support
Animations for better user engagement
Offline Mode for tracking without internet
🚀 Phase 5: Deployment & Maintenance

Tasks:
✅ Infrastructure Setup:

CI/CD with GitHub Actions for automated deployment
Docker Containers for backend scalability
Monitoring (Datadog, Prometheus, AWS CloudWatch)
✅ Security & Compliance:

SSL & HTTPS enforced
Regular security audits
2FA for added user security
✅ User Feedback & Improvements:

Implement A/B testing for UI/feature improvements
In-app user surveys for feature suggestions
